# Eolic-Turbine-EDA-and-Power-Prediction

In this project the data from an 2018 Scada Data of a Wind Turbine in Turkey was analyzed.
First, an EDA was carried out in order to learn more from the data.
Then, several models were implemented (polynomic regression, Random Forest and Boost Gradien Tree Regression), and the performance of each model was analyzed
